# python-100daysofcode-projects
## This repo is hosting multiple projects I'm working on while learning python with Dr. Angela Yu's 100Days of Code course.

- [x] Day1 project: ***Band Name Generator***. This simple project applied the lesson from Day1 which include ***printing inputs, variables, new lines, string manipulation, debugging*** and a whole lot more. 
- [x] Day2 project: ***Tips Calculator***. This project put together some of the key concepts learned in Day2 session including ***printing messages to the user, obtaining user input, assigning values to variables, conducting mathematical operations, and presenting formatted output using f-strings***.
